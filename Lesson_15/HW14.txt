Practice

1. Modify the Country class to include a third instance attribute 
called capital as a string. Store your new class in a script and
test it out by adding the following code at the bottom of the script:

japan = Country('Japan', 140_000_000, 'Tokyo')
print(f"{japan.name} population is {japan.population}
and capital is {japan.capital}.")

The output of your script should be:
Japan population is 140000000 and capital is Tokyo.

2. Add increase_population method to country class. 
This method should take an argument and increase population
of the country on this number.

3.Create add method to add two countries together. 
This method should create another country object with the name
of the two countries combined and population of the two countries 
added together.

bosnia = Country('Bosnia', 10_000_000)
herzegovina = Country('Herzegovina', 5_000_000)

bosnia_herzegovina = bosnia.add(herzegovina)
bosnia_herzegovina.population -> 15_000_000
bosnia_herzegovina.name -> 'Bosnia Herzegovina'

4. (Optional) Implement previous method with magic method
bosnia = Country('Bosnia', 10_000_000)
herzegovina = Country('Herzegovina', 5_000_000)

bosnia_herzegovina = bosnia + herzegovina
bosnia_herzegovina.population -> 15_000_000
bosnia_herzegovina.name -> 'Bosnia Herzegovina'
