Practice

1. Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods
which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.

2. Write a Python program to crate two empty classes, Student and Marks.
Now create some instances and check whether they are instances of the said
classes or not. Also, check whether the said classes are subclasses of the
built-in object class or not.

3. A Bank

A. Using the Account class as a base class, write two derived classes
called SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. A SavingsAccount object, in
addition to the attributes of an Account object, should have an interest
attribute and a method which adds interest to the account. A CurrentAccount
object, in addition to the attributes of an Account object, should have
an overdraft limit attribute.

B. Now create a Bank class, an object of which contains an array of
Account objects. Accounts in the array could be instances of the Account
class, the SavingsAccount class, or the CurrentAccount class. Create some
test accounts (some of each type).

C. Write an update method in the Bank class. It iterates through each
account, updating it in the following ways: Savings accounts get interest
added (via the method you already wrote); CurrentAccounts get a letter sent
if they are in overdraft. (use print to 'send' the letter).

D. The Bank class requires methods for opening and closing accounts, and for
paying a dividend into each account.
